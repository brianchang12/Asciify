# asciify

Android app that takes pictures and converts them to ascii text files.

## How to Use

Simply take pictures using your device's camera, hit the ascii convert button and create a .txt ascii file of your photo. Photos are all saved in the getExternalStorageDirectory() and get saved when tapping the save button. You can convert photos you have already taken in your phone into ascii photos. Other features include the ability to crop photos and deleting saved photos.
